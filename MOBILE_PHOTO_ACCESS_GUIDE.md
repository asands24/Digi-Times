## Testing on iPhone

### How to Test:

1. **Open on iPhone**
   ```
   Visit: https://digitimes-test.netlify.app
   Login → Navigate to Newsletter → Add Event → Add Photos
   ```

2. **Test Camera Access**
   - Tap "Take Photo"
   - Grant camera permission if asked
   - Take photo
   - Verify photo appears in upload queue

3. **Test Photo Library**
   - Tap "Choose from Library"
   - Select multiple photos
   - Verify all selected photos appear

4. **Test Upload**
   - Click "Upload"
   - Watch progress bar

### Common Issues & Solutions:

❌ **"Camera not working"**
✅ Solution: Check Safari Settings → Camera → Allow for your site

❌ **"Can't select multiple photos"**
✅ Solution: Ensure using "Choose from Library" button, not "Take Photo"

❌ **"Upload fails"**
✅ Solution: Check file size (<10MB), internet connection, and Supabase status

❌ **"Photos appear sideways"**
✅ Solution: Browser should auto-rotate; if not, it's a browser bug (rare)

## API Reference

### PhotoUpload Component Props:

```javascript
<PhotoUpload
  eventId={string}           // Required: Event to attach photos to
  onUploadComplete={function} // Callback after successful upload
  multiple={boolean}          // Allow multiple file selection (default: true)
/>
```

### usePhotos Hook:

```javascript
const {
  uploadPhoto,              // Upload single photo
  uploadMultiplePhotos,     // Upload multiple photos
  uploading,                // Boolean: upload in progress
  uploadProgress,           // Number: 0-100 percentage
  deletePhoto,              // Delete a photo
  updatePhotoCaption,       // Update photo caption
  getPhotoUrl,              // Get public URL for display
  downloadPhoto             // Download photo to device
} = usePhotos()
```

## Progressive Web App (PWA) Considerations

Your app can be "installed" on iPhone as a PWA:

1. **Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen**
2. **Opens like native app**
3. **Same photo access as web version**
4. **Faster loading with caching**

### PWA Photo Features:

- ✅ Camera access works
- ✅ Photo library access works
- ✅ Offline photo queue (coming soon)
- ✅ Background uploads (coming soon)

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection:

✅ **HTTPS Only**: All photo uploads encrypted
✅ **User Authentication**: Only authenticated users can upload
✅ **Access Control**: Users only see photos in their groups
✅ **Secure Storage**: Supabase Storage with RLS policies
✅ **No Tracking**: Photos not analyzed or shared

### Privacy Features:

- Photos only visible to group members
- No EXIF GPS data extraction
- Users can delete their own photos
- Group admins can moderate content

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Checklist:

1. ✅ Using HTTPS (not HTTP)
2. ✅ Modern browser (Safari 14+, Chrome 90+)
3. ✅ Camera/Photo permissions granted
4. ✅ Stable internet connection
5. ✅ Supabase Storage configured
6. ✅ File under 10MB
7. ✅ Supported image format

### Browser Console Errors:

If upload fails, check browser console (Safari → Develop → Show JavaScript Console):

```javascript
// Common errors:
"Storage bucket not found" → Check Supabase setup
"Permission denied" → Check authentication
"File too large" → Reduce file size
"Network error" → Check internet connection
```
